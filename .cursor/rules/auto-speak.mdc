# Auto-Speak Rule

After EVERY response, you MUST use the `speak` tool from the `Chatterbox` MCP server to speak your response aloud.

## Rules:
1. Provide a concise summary of your response (1-3 sentences max) to the `text` parameter of the `speak` tool.
2. Do NOT include code in the spoken text - only explanations
3. Keep it natural and conversational
4. Always call the `speak` tool as the LAST action in your response
5. If the response is purely code with no explanation, speak: "Here's the code you requested."

## Example:
If you explain how to fix a bug, speak: "I found the issue. The variable was undefined because it was declared inside the if block. I've moved it outside so it's accessible everywhere."
